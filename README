= SkyTools - tools for PostgreSQL =

This is a package of tools in use in Skype for replication and failover.
It also includes a generic queuing mechanism PgQ and utility library for
Python scripts, as well as a script for setting up and managing WAL based
standby servers.

== Overview ==

It contains following modules:

=== PgQ ===

PgQ is a queuing system written in PL/pgsql, Python and C code. It is
based on snapshot based event handling ideas from Slony-I, written for
general usage.

PgQ provides an efficient, transactionnal, queueing system with
multi-nodes support (including work sharing and splitting, failover and
switchover, for queues and for consumers).

Rules:

- There can be several queues in database.
- There can be several producers than can insert into any queue.
- There can be several consumers on one queue.
- There can be several subconsumers on a consumer.

PgQ is splited into 3 layers: Producers, Ticker and Consumers.

*Producers*  and *Consumers* respectively push and read events into a
queue. Producers just need to call PostgreSQL stored procedures (like a
trigger on a table or a PostgreSQL call from the application). And
consumers are frequently written in Python, the prefered language as it
has a powerful SKytools Framework but it is not limitative and any
language able to run PostgreSQL stored procedures can be used.

*Ticker* is a daemon which splits the queues in batch of events and
handle the maintenance of the system. The Ticker is provided with the
Skytools.

- PgQ admin tool (qadm) usage: link:doc/qadmin.html[]

- PgQ SQL reference: link:pgq/[]

=== Londiste ===

Replication tool written in Python, using PgQ as event transport.

Features:

- Tables can be added one-by-one into set.
- Initial COPY for one table does not block event replay for other
  tables.
- Can compare tables on both sides.

Documentation:

- Londiste script usage: doc/londiste3.txt
  (also available as `man 1 londiste`)

- Londiste HOWTOS: doc/howto/

=== walmgr ===

This script will setup WAL archiving, does initial backup and
runtime WAL archive and restore.

It can also be used for up-to-last-second partial file copying,
so less than whole file is lost in case of loss of master database server.

== Upgrade from 2.1 ==

Assuming PgQ + Londiste setup.  This will upgrade PgQ to 3.0 and install
Londiste 3 in parallel with Londiste 2.

1. Install Postgres modules.  They are backwards compatible with 2.1.
2. Stop `pgqadm.py ticker` processes.
3. Apply ./upgrade/final/v3.0_pgq_core.sql
4. Apply installed pgq_node.sql
5. Apply installed londiste.sql - this will throw error on CREATE SCHEMA, but should otherwise apply fine.
6. Start pgqd.
