= SkyTools - tools for PostgreSQL =

This is a package of tools in use in Skype for replication and
failover.  Also it includes a generic queuing mechanism PgQ and
utility library for Python scripts.

== Overview ==

It contains following tools:

=== PgQ ===

This is the queue mechanism we use. It consists of PL/pgsql, and C code
in database, with Python framework on top of it.  It is based on
snapshot based event handling ideas from Slony-I, written for general
usage.

Features:

- There can be several queues in database.
- There can be several producers than can insert into any queue.
- There can be several consumers on one queue and all consumers see
   all events.

Documentation:

- http://skytools.projects.postgresql.org/skytools-3.0/

=== Londiste ===

Replication tool written in Python, using PgQ as event transport.

Features:

- Tables can be added one-by-one into set.
- Initial COPY for one table does not block event replay for other
  tables.
- Can compare tables on both sides.

Documentation:

- Londiste script usage: doc/londiste.cmdline.txt
  (also available as `man 1 londiste`)
- Londiste configuration: doc/londiste.config.txt
  (also available as `man 5 londiste`)
- Londiste reference: doc/londiste.ref.txt

=== walmgr ===

This script will setup WAL archiving, does initial backup and
runtime WAL archive and restore.

== Upgrade from 2.1 ==

Assuming PgQ + Londiste setup.  This will upgrade PgQ to 3.0 and install
Londiste 3 in parallel with Londiste 2.

1. Install Postgres modules.  They are backwards compatible with 2.1.
2. Stop `pgqadm.py ticker` processes.
3. Apply ./upgrade/final/v3.0_pgq_core.sql
4. Apply installed pgq_node.sql
5. Apply installed londiste.sql - this will throw error on CREATE SCHEMA, but should otherwise apply fine.
6. Start pgqd.
