High-prority
============

* docs: londiste, pgq/python, pgq/sql, skytools, walmgr

Larger things
-------------
* chained replication, switchover
* Write PgQ triggers in C

Smaller things
--------------
* londiste * remove tbl should work also if table is already dropped
* RemoteConsumer/SerialConsumer/pgq_ext sanity, too much duplication
* backend modules need to be ported to 8.3
* pgqadm: separate priod for retry queue processing
* londiste: create tables on subscriber
* pgqadm: Utility commands:
  reg-copy que cons1 cons2
  reg-move que cons1 cons2
  queue-rename
  show-batch-events
  del-event
* install .sql files under share/skytools in addition to contrib/

Low-priority
============

Larger things
-------------
* denytriggers on subscriber
* Quote SQL identifiers, keep combined name, rule will be "Split schema as first dot"
* londiste: good fkey support:
    store them in subscriber db and apply when both tables are in sync.
* skylog/logdb: publish sample logdb schema, with some tools
* londiste: allow table redirection on subscriber side
* sequence registration on provider
* trigger handling

Smaller things
--------------
* skytools: switch for silence for cron scripts
* pgq: drop_fkeys.sql for live envs
* logdb: hostname
* contrib/*.sql loading from python - need to check db version
* DBScript: failure to write pidfile should be logged (crontscripts)
* ideas from SlonyI:
  - force timestamps to ISO
  - when buffering queries, check their size

Just ideas
===========

* skytools: config-less operation?
* skytools: config from database?
* skytools: partial sql parser for log processing

Dropped
-------
* txid: decide on renaming functions

walmgr
======

- copy master config to slave
- slave needs to decide which config to use
