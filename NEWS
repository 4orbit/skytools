2007-04-10  -  SkyTools 2.1.3  -  "Brown Paper Bag"

    Still managed to sneak in a last-minute typo.

    * Fix copy-paste error in table_copy.py
    * Remember to bump version in pgq.version()

2007-04-09  -  SkyTools 2.1.2  -  "Help screen works"

    Most fallout from reorg is hopefully cleaned now.

    * Dumb bug in ticker wich made it almost non-working,
      except it managed to complete the regression test...
    * Move --skip-truncate switch from 'copy' to 'londiste add'.
    * 'londiste install' also installs plpgsql+plpythonu.
    * SQL installer logs full path to file it found.
    * Change pgq.get_queue_info() FOR loop variable to record
      instead text that was reported to fail, although it did work here.
    * Remember where the SQL files were installed.

2007-04-06  -  SkyTools 2.1.1  -  "Needs more thrust to fly"

    SkyTools got big reorg before release, but with the hoopla
    with the 3 projects at once, it did not get much testing...
    There are some untested areas still, but at least pgq/londiste
    are in better shape now.

    * pgqadm: finish conversion...
    * londiste.Syncer:
      - Convert to new API
      - Avoid ticking, parallel ticks are dangerous
      - Bad arg in repair
    * pgq:
      - too aggressive check in register_consumer
      - Algo desc for batch_event_sql
    * Add some knobs to make regtests for londiste pass
      more predictibly.

2007-03-13  -  SkyTools 2.1  -  "Radioactive Candy"

    * Final public release.
